        <section id="squat" class="gray">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Squats</h4>
            <p>A squat is a fundamental lower body exercise that involves bending your knees and hips while keeping your
                torso upright, essentially lowering your body towards the ground and then returning to a standing
                position. It's a versatile compound movement that engages multiple muscle groups, including the
                quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and lower back.</p>
            <p>To perform a basic bodyweight squat:</p>
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xqvCmoLULNY"

                <p>
                    Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and toes slightly turned out. Keep
                    your
                    chest up and shoulders back to maintain a neutral spine. Initiate the movement by simultaneously
                    bending
                    your hips and knees, pushing your hips back as if sitting into an imaginary chair. Lower yourself
                    until
                    your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, ensuring your knees track over your toes. Keep your
                    weight centered over your midfoot and your heels in contact with the ground. Then, push through your
                    heels to straighten your knees and hips, returning to the standing position. Maintain proper posture
                    throughout, with your back straight and core engaged. Remember to breathe in as you descend and
                    exhale
                    as you rise. Squats engage the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core muscles, making them a
                    versatile
                    and effective lower body exercise.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>Remember that form is crucial when performing squats to prevent injuries. If you're new to squats,
                consider seeking guidance from a fitness professional to ensure you're using the correct technique and
                gradually increasing the intensity of the exercise as your strength and comfort levels improve.</p>

        <!--Barbell Squat-->
        <section id="barbell-squat" class="blue">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Barbell Squats</h4>
            <p>The barbell squat is a fundamental and compound strength training exercise that involves lifting a
                weighted barbell while performing a squatting motion. It's considered one of the most effective and
                challenging exercises for building lower body strength, muscle mass, and overall functional fitness. In
                the barbell squat, the load is placed across the upper back and shoulders, engaging not only the legs
                but also the core and back muscles to maintain stability and proper form. This exercise targets major
                muscle groups, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, lower back, and core. The barbell squat is
                highly adaptable, allowing for various squatting depths and stances to emphasize different muscle
                groups. Due to its complexity and potential for heavy loading, proper technique and safety measures are
                paramount when performing barbell squats, making it essential to learn the movement under the guidance
                of experienced trainers to maximize its benefits and reduce the risk of injury. Whether you're an
                athlete, bodybuilder, or fitness enthusiast, the barbell squat is a key component of a well-rounded
                strength training routine.</p>
            <p>To perform a barbell squat:</p>
            <div class="video">

        <!--Deadlift-->
        <section id="deadlift" class="brown">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Deadlifts</h4>
            The deadlift is a foundational compound exercise in strength training that involves lifting a barbell or
            weight from the ground to a standing position. It primarily targets the muscles of the lower back, glutes,
            hamstrings, and grip strength, making it a powerful movement for building overall strength and functional
            fitness. The deadlift is executed by bending at the hips and knees, grasping the barbell, and then lifting
            it while maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core.
            <p>To perform a basic conventional deadlift:</p>
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZXobu7JvvE"
                    title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0"
                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>To perform a deadlift, start by placing a barbell on the ground, centered over your feet. Stand with
                    your feet hip-width apart and toes beneath the bar. Bend at your hips and knees to grip the barbell
                    with an overhand or mixed grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. With a straight back,
                    chest up, and shoulders back, lift the barbell by pushing through your heels and extending your hips
                    and knees simultaneously. Maintain a neutral spine throughout the lift, engaging your core and
                    avoiding hyperextension. Once fully upright, lower the barbell back to the ground by bending your
                    hips and knees, ensuring controlled movement and keeping the barbell close to your body. Proper form
                    is vital to prevent injury and optimize the benefits of the deadlift, targeting muscles like the
                    lower back, glutes, and hamstrings while fostering overall strength and functional fitness.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Maintaining proper form ensures that you're effectively engaging the target muscles while minimizing the
                risk of strain or injury. A neutral spine protects your lower back from excessive stress, and a strong
                core provides stability throughout the lift. Focusing on lifting with your hips and legs rather than
                relying solely on your back minimizes the risk of overloading your lumbar region.</p>

        <!--Calve-->
        <section id="calve" class="gray">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Calve Exercises</h4>
            <p>The calves, also known as the calf muscles, are a group of muscles located in the lower back portion of
                the leg, specifically on the posterior side. They are responsible for various movements involving the
                ankle joint and play a significant role in walking, running, jumping, and maintaining balance.</p>
            <p>This video demonstrates a few calve exercises. Exercising the calves is important because it:</p>
            <div class="video">
                <ol>
                    <li>Supports Mobility: Strong calf muscles aid in walking, running, and various lower body
                        movements.
                        Enhances Balance: Well-developed calves contribute to overall lower body stability and balance.
                        Aids in Propulsion: Strong calves assist in pushing off the ground during activities like
                        running
                        and jumping.</li>
                    <li>Prevents Injuries: Strengthened calves reduce the risk of strains, Achilles tendon issues, and
                        other
                        lower leg injuries.</li>
                    <li>Promotes Circulation: Active calf muscles facilitate blood flow back to the heart, aiding in
                        overall
                        circulation.</li>
                    <li>Improves Aesthetic: Toned calves contribute to a balanced and aesthetically pleasing lower body
                        appearance.</li>
                </ol>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C7qnbmpLNGI"

        <!--Lunge-->
        <section id="lunge" class="blue">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Lunges</h4>
            <p>The lunge is a multi-joint exercise that can help tone and strengthen many muscles in the lower body.
                This includes the quads (front of the thighs), hamstrings (back of the thighs), glutes (buttocks), and
                calves (back of the lower leg).</p>
            <p>To perform a basic forward lunge:</p>
            <div class="video">
                <p>Bend the knees and lower your body until the back knee is a few inches from the floor. At the bottom
                    of the movement, the front thigh is parallel to the ground, the back knee points toward the floor,
                    and your weight is evenly distributed between both legs. After that, Push back up to the starting
                    position, keeping your weight on the heel of the front foot.</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L8fvypPrzzs"
