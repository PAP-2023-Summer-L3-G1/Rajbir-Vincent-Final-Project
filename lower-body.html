                    bending
                    your hips and knees, pushing your hips back as if sitting into an imaginary chair. Lower yourself
                    until
                    your thighs are at least parallel to the ground, ensuring your knees track over your toes. Keep your
                    weight centered over your midfoot and your heels in contact with the ground. Then, push through your
                    heels to straighten your knees and hips, returning to the standing position. Maintain proper posture
                    throughout, with your back straight and core engaged. Remember to breathe in as you descend and
                    exhale
                    as you rise. Squats engage the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and core muscles, making them a
                    versatile
                    and effective lower body exercise.

        <section id="deadlift" class="brown">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Deadlifts</h4>
            The deadlift is a foundational compound exercise in strength training that involves lifting a barbell or
            weight from the ground to a standing position. It primarily targets the muscles of the lower back, glutes,
            hamstrings, and grip strength, making it a powerful movement for building overall strength and functional
            fitness. The deadlift is executed by bending at the hips and knees, grasping the barbell, and then lifting
            it while maintaining a neutral spine and engaged core.
            <p>To perform a basic conventional deadlift:</p>
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZXobu7JvvE"

                    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"
                    allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>To perform a deadlift, start by placing a barbell on the ground, centered over your feet. Stand with
                    your feet hip-width apart and toes beneath the bar. Bend at your hips and knees to grip the barbell
                    with an overhand or mixed grip, hands slightly wider than shoulder-width. With a straight back,
                    chest up, and shoulders back, lift the barbell by pushing through your heels and extending your hips
                    and knees simultaneously. Maintain a neutral spine throughout the lift, engaging your core and
                    avoiding hyperextension. Once fully upright, lower the barbell back to the ground by bending your
                    hips and knees, ensuring controlled movement and keeping the barbell close to your body. Proper form
                    is vital to prevent injury and optimize the benefits of the deadlift, targeting muscles like the
                    lower back, glutes, and hamstrings while fostering overall strength and functional fitness.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Maintaining proper form ensures that you're effectively engaging the target muscles while minimizing the
                risk of strain or injury. A neutral spine protects your lower back from excessive stress, and a strong
                core provides stability throughout the lift. Focusing on lifting with your hips and legs rather than
                relying solely on your back minimizes the risk of overloading your lumbar region.</p>
