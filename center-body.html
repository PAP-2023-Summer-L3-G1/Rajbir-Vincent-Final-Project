        <!--Stretching-->
        <section id="cb-stretching" class="tan">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Stretches</h4>
            <p>The abdominal stretch is a great exercise to incorporate into your warm-up routine before engaging in
                more intense physical
                activities. It helps prepare the abdominal muscles for movement and prevents strain during workouts.
                Additionally, it can be
                beneficial to do the abdominal stretch after long periods of sitting or as part of a cool-down
                routine
                to release tension in
                the core and lower back.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <p>To perform a abdominal stretch, stand tall or kneel comfortably. Lift your arms
                    overhead, intertwining your fingers. Lean gently to one side, creating a wonderful stretch
                    through the opposite side of your torso. Embrace the stretch for about 15-30 seconds on each
                    side, and remember to breathe deeply. Finally, release and enjoy the refreshed feeling in your
                    abdominal area.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Please remember that stretching should never be painful. If you experience any discomfort or pain
                while
                performing the
                abdominal stretch, stop immediately and consult a fitness professional or healthcare provider for
                guidance.</p>

            <p>Sit-ups are a classic and effective core-strengthening exercise that targets your abdominal muscles.
                They
                are
                beginner-friendly and can be performed virtually anywhere without the need for any equipment. </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor.</li>
                    <li>Place your hands gently behind your head, avoiding neck strain.</li>
                    <li>Engage your core muscles and exhale as you lift your upper body towards your thighs.</li>
                    <li>Pause briefly at the top, feeling the contraction in your abdominal muscles.</li>
                    <li>Inhale as you slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position.</li>
                    <li>Repeat the movement for your desired number of repetitions, maintaining controlled motions
                        throughout.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>Remember to maintain proper form and avoid pulling with your hands or using momentum. If you're a
                beginner, start with a
                manageable number of repetitions and gradually increase as you get stronger and more comfortable
                with
                the exercise. As
                with any exercise, listen to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort or pain.</p>

        <!--Russian Twists-->
        <section id="russian-twists" class="green">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Russian Twists</h4>
            <p>The Russian twist is a core-strengthening exercise that targets the oblique muscles on the sides of
                the
                abdomen.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <p>To perform it, sit on the floor with bent knees and feet flat on the ground, leaning back
                    slightly with a straight back and lifted chest. Hold your hands together in front of your chest
                    or a
                    weight for added challenge. Engage your core, exhale, and twist your torso to the right, then
                    back
                    to
                    the center, and finally to the left, contracting your obliques throughout the movement. Keep
                    your
                    hips
                    and lower body stable to isolate the upper body.</p>
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itL2xqQYlgk"

            </div>

            <p>Regularly incorporating the Russian twist into your workout routine can help tone your waistline,
                improve
                rotational strength, stability, and balance in your core. Start with a comfortable number of
                repetitions
                and gradually increase as you get more comfortable with the exercise. Remember to perform the
                movement
                with control and avoid using momentum to swing your upper body. If you experience any discomfort or
                pain, stop the exercise and seek advice from a fitness professional or healthcare provider. Happy
                twisting and strengthening those side abs!</p>

            <h4 class="video-titles">Plank</h4>
            <p>The plank is a simple yet highly effective exercise that targets your core muscles, including your
                abdominal muscles, back muscles, and stabilizing muscles. It also engages your shoulders, chest, and
                glutes. Proper plank form is crucial for maximizing the benefits and preventing injury.</p>

                better functional fitness and reduced risk of back pain. Remember to prioritize proper form over
                duration, and always listen to your body to avoid strain or discomfort.
