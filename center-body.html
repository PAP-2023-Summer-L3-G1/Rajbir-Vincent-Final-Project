        <h4 class="video-titles">Abodminal Stretch</h4>
        <p>The abdominal stretch is a great exercise to incorporate into your warm-up routine before engaging in more intense physical
           activities. It helps prepare the abdominal muscles for movement and prevents strain during workouts. Additionally, it can be 
           beneficial to do the abdominal stretch after long periods of sitting or as part of a cool-down routine to release tension in 
           the core and lower back.</p>
        <p>Please remember that stretching should never be painful. If you experience any discomfort or pain while performing the
           abdominal stretch, stop immediately and consult a fitness professional or healthcare provider for guidance.</p>

        <!--Russian Twists-->
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itL2xqQYlgk" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4 class="video-titles">Russian Twists</h4>
        <p>The Russian twist is a core-strengthening exercise that targets the oblique muscles on the sides of the abdomen. To perform it, sit on the floor with bent knees and feet flat on the ground, leaning back slightly with a straight back and lifted chest. Hold your hands together in front of your chest or a weight for added challenge. Engage your core, exhale, and twist your torso to the right, then back to the center, and finally to the left, contracting your obliques throughout the movement. Keep your hips and lower body stable to isolate the upper body.</p>
        <p>Regularly incorporating the Russian twist into your workout routine can help tone your waistline, improve rotational strength, stability, and balance in your core. Start with a comfortable number of repetitions and gradually increase as you get more comfortable with the exercise. Remember to perform the movement with control and avoid using momentum to swing your upper body. If you experience any discomfort or pain, stop the exercise and seek advice from a fitness professional or healthcare provider. Happy twisting and strengthening those side abs!</p>

        <!--Sit Ups-->

        <h4 class="video-titles">Sit Ups</h4>
        <p>Sit-ups are a classic and effective core-strengthening exercise that targets your abdominal muscles. They are 
           beginner-friendly and can be performed virtually anywhere without the need for any equipment. </p>
        <p>To perform a sit-up, lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Place your hands behind your head or 
            cross them over your chest for neck support. Engage your core, lift your upper body towards your knees using your abs, 
            hold briefly, and then lower back down with control.</p>
        <p>Remember to maintain proper form and avoid pulling with your hands or using momentum. If you're a beginner, start with a 
           manageable number of repetitions and gradually increase as you get stronger and more comfortable with the exercise. As 
           with any exercise, listen to your body and stop if you experience any discomfort or pain.</p>

        <!--Pull Ups-->
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAggnpPyR6E" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <h4 class="video-titles">Pull Ups</h4>
        <p>The pull-up is a challenging and effective upper-body exercise that primarily targets the muscles in the back, 
           specifically the latissimus dorsi, biceps, and forearms. It is a bodyweight exercise where you lift your body up
           towards a bar, using your arms and back muscles to perform the movement. Pull-ups are known for building strength,
           improving posture, and enhancing upper body muscularity. While they may be difficult for beginners, they can be 
           gradually mastered with practice and are a valuable addition to any strength training routine.</p>
        <p>To do a pull-up, start by gripping an overhead bar with your palms facing away from you, hands slightly wider
           than shoulder-width apart. Hang with your arms fully extended, engage your core, and then pull your body upward
           towards the bar until your chin is above it. Lower yourself back down with control to complete one repetition,
           focusing on using your back and arm muscles to perform the movement.</p>
