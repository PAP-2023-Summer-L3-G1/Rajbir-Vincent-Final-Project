            <h4 class="video-titles">Upper Body Exercises</h4>
            <p>This video demonstrates exercises that target the arms and shoulders. Exercising the arms and shoulders is vital for people in wheelchairs due to several reasons:

                Functional Independence: Strong arms and shoulders enable independent movement, maneuvering the wheelchair, and performing daily tasks.
                Improved Mobility: Strong upper body muscles enhance the ability to navigate various surfaces and overcome obstacles.
                Cardiovascular Health: Upper body exercises engage the cardiovascular system, promoting heart health and endurance.
                Prevention of Shoulder Issues: Regular exercise can prevent shoulder pain and injuries caused by overuse and poor posture.
                Enhanced Quality of Life: Strong arms and shoulders contribute to an active, engaged lifestyle and greater self-confidence.
                Bone Health: Weight-bearing upper body exercises help maintain bone density and reduce the risk of fractures.
                Overall Fitness: Including upper body workouts supports a balanced fitness routine, promoting overall health and well-being.

                Incorporating arm and shoulder exercises into a wheelchair user's routine can lead to better physical health, mobility, and overall quality of life.</p>

            <h4 class="video-titles">Center Body Exercises</h4>
            <p>This video shows how to build stomach muscles if you are unable to stand, either temporarily or permanently. Despite this disability, there are still ways you can build your stomach muscles! Exercising the core (center body) is crucial for people in wheelchairs because:

                Stability: A strong core provides stability while sitting, helping maintain an upright posture and preventing slumping.
                Balance: Core strength improves balance, reducing the risk of falls or accidents in the wheelchair.
                Functional Movement: A strong core supports reaching, transferring, and performing everyday tasks with greater ease.
                Prevention of Pain: Core exercises alleviate strain on the back, reducing the likelihood of discomfort or pain.
                Better Respiration: Strong core muscles aid in efficient breathing and lung function.
                Overall Strength: A solid core complements upper body strength, contributing to improved mobility and independence.
                
                By focusing on core exercises, individuals in wheelchairs can enhance their comfort, functionality, and overall well-being.

                Mobility: Strengthened leg muscles improve movement and help with transfers, transfers, and weight-bearing tasks.
                Independence: Strong legs enable greater self-reliance in daily activities and reduce reliance on assistive devices.
                Bone Health: Weight-bearing exercises promote bone density, reducing the risk of fractures.
                Circulation: Leg exercises enhance blood flow, aiding healing and preventing issues like pressure sores.
                Range of Motion: Leg workouts increase flexibility, making movements and positioning easier.
                Overall Fitness: Engaging leg muscles contributes to improved overall cardiovascular health and fitness.
