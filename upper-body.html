            <h4 class="video-titles">Stretches</h4>
            <p>Stretching before exercising is crucial for injury prevention, as it increases flexibility and
                prepares muscles for
                physical activity. It improves circulation, reduces muscle tension, and enhances performance.
                Additionally, it helps
                mentally prepare for the workout and can lead to better posture and range of motion. This is why
                we
                recommend doing
                the stretches in the video above before partaking in the following exercises.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <p>To perform a pectoral stretch, interlace your fingers behind your back with palms facing inward.
                    Straighten your arms gently, feeling a stretch across your chest and shoulders. Lift your arms
                    upward while maintaining a straight posture, holding the stretch for 15-30 seconds. Release the
                    interlock and repeat 2-3 times to enhance chest muscle flexibility.</p>

            <p>Incorporating pectoral stretches into your routine, especially if you have a sedentary lifestyle or
                engage in activities that strain the upper body, can contribute to improved physical well-being and
                overall quality of life.</p>

        <!--Biceps Curl-->

            <h4 class="video-titles">Biceps Curl</h4>
            <p>The biceps curl is a fundamental resistance exercise that targets the biceps brachii muscles, which
                are located on the front
                of your upper arms. It is one of the most common and popular exercises for building arm strength and
                size, making it a staple
                in many strength training and bodybuilding routines.</p>
            <p>In its basic form, the biceps curl is performed using dumbbells or a barbell. Here's how to do a
                standard dumbbell biceps curl:</p>
            <div class="video">
                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3OZ2MT_5r3Q"

                <ol>
                    <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and shoulders relaxed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Hold a dumbbell in each hand with your palms facing forward, and let your arms fully extend
                        down
                        by your sides.</li>
                    <li>Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.</li>
                    <li>Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly curl the dumbbells towards your shoulders,
                        contracting your biceps as you lift.</li>
                    <li>Hold the peak contraction for a brief moment, squeezing your biceps at the top.</li>
                    <li>Lower the dumbbells back down in a controlled manner to the starting position.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>It's important to remember that proper form is crucial when performing biceps curls to avoid injury
                and maximize
                muscle engagement. Avoid using momentum or swinging your body to lift the weight, and focus on a
                slow and controlled
                movement. Additionally, choose an appropriate weight that allows you to complete the desired number
                of repetitions
                with good form. For any other questions you may have please look at the video above for guidance.

        <!--Bench Press-->
        <section id="bench-press" class="brown">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Bench Press</h4>
            <p>The bench press is a popular and fundamental exercise in the world of strength training and
                bodybuilding.
                It is a compound movement that primarily targets the chest muscles, but also engages the shoulders,
                triceps, and other
                supporting muscles in the upper body. This exercise is widely practiced in gyms and fitness centers
                as it helps build
                upper body strength and muscle mass.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <p>In a typical bench press, you lie flat on a bench with your feet on the ground or elevated, and
                    your
                    back, shoulders,
                    and head in contact with the bench. You then grip the barbell with both hands, usually a little
                    wider than shoulder-width
                    apart. The barbell is then lifted off a rack or taken from a spotter, and you slowly lower it
                    towards your chest, allowing
                    your elbows to bend. Once the barbell touches your chest or comes close to it, you push it back
                    up
                    to the starting position,
                    fully extending your arms.</p>

            </div>
            <p>While the bench press is an effective exercise for building upper body strength and muscle mass, it
                also carries some risks
                if not performed with proper form or appropriate weight. It is essential to warm up properly and use
                a spotter, especially
                when lifting heavy weights, to avoid potential injuries. To avoid this please look at the video
                above.</p>

                shoulders and chest are push ups!
                The push-up is a fundamental bodyweight exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, primarily the
                chest, shoulders, and triceps.
                It's an excellent exercise for building upper body strength and can be performed by beginners to

            <p>The lateral raise is a popular strength training exercise that primarily targets the deltoid muscles
                of the shoulders. It is designed to build shoulder strength and enhance shoulder stability, making
                it a valuable addition to upper body workout routines.</p>
            <div class="video">
                <p>In a lateral raise, you typically start by standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding
                    dumbbells or other resistance weights in each hand. With a slight bend in your elbows, you raise
                    both arms out to the sides, keeping them parallel to the ground. The movement is controlled, and
                    the
                    focus is on engaging the shoulder muscles without using momentum or swinging.</p>

            <p>As with any exercise, proper form is essential to avoid injury and maximize the benefits. If you're
                new to the lateral raise or weight training in general, it's advisable to start with lighter weights

        <!--Dumbbell Kickback-->
        <section id="dumbbell-kickback" class="brown">
            <h4 class="video-titles">Dumbbell Kickback</h4>
            <p>The dumbbell raise is a highly effective and versatile exercise that plays a crucial role in
                strengthening the shoulder
                muscles and improving overall upper body function. By targeting the deltoid muscles, which consist
                of the anterior (front),
                lateral (middle), and posterior (rear) heads, this exercise helps create well-rounded and
                aesthetically pleasing shoulders.
                Additionally, it engages various stabilizing muscles, including the trapezius and rotator cuff
                muscles, promoting better
                shoulder joint stability and reducing the risk of injuries.</p>
            <p>To perform a dumbbell raise:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, keeping your back straight and core engaged.</li>
                    <li>Hold a dumbbell in each hand at your sides, with your palms facing inward (neutral grip).
                    </li>
                    <li>With a slight bend in your elbows, lift both arms out to the sides until they are
                        approximately parallel to the ground. Keep your arms in line with your shoulders throughout
                        the movement.</li>
                    <li>Hold the peak position for a brief moment, focusing on engaging the lateral deltoids.</li>
                    <li>Lower the dumbbells back down in a controlled manner to the starting position.</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <p>When incorporating the dumbbell raise into your workout routine, pay careful attention to form and
                technique. Avoid using
                momentum or swinging the weights, as this can lead to injury and diminish the effectiveness of the
                exercise. Instead, focus
                on controlled and deliberate movements, emphasizing the contraction of the shoulder muscles at the
                peak of the lift.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, the dumbbell raise is an essential exercise for anyone looking to develop strong and
                shapely shoulders while
                enhancing overall upper body stability. Its versatility, scalability, and functional benefits make
                it a valuable addition
                to any strength training regimen. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced lifter, mastering the
                dumbbell raise can
                yield significant improvements in your shoulder strength, posture, and aesthetics, leading to a more
                confident and capable
                you.</p>
